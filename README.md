## Unfollow me if you can :)

A selenium automation that unfollows or shows you people who don't follow you.
In this automation, a simple but understandable interface has been designed thanks to the "**TKinter**" library.
This automation detects people you follow but do not follow you and shows these ins to you with the help of "**TKinter**".

*Compared to other automations, thanks to this interface, you can increase the sustainability of the program by typing personal information such as your username and password into this interface instead of typing in the code fields.*

## Before you start:
**You should enter your geeko driver path on the driver path variable**

Thats it now who can unfollow you ?
